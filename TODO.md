TODO
--------
[x] tests failing inconsistently
[ ] run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
[ ] bug: warning from sass parser. "start value has mixed support, consider using flex-start instead" generated by @material.  This is a valid value as per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items and the loader is wrong.
[ ] bug: on double-click of sidebar resizer to minimize left nav, horizontal scrollbars appear
[ ] bug: drag material slider not working (likely canceling default on a drag event somewhere?)
[ ] bug: fix warning message in dark theme.  Needs dark text.
[ ] bug: fix <pre> color in dark theme mode
[x] bug: in non-dark-theme mode, selected calendar date should use white on primary color
[ ] bug: fix progress indicators in dark theme mode. Should use transparent instead of white for fade color.
[x] Create continuous deployment workflow.  Update jenkins file.  Provide documentation about the repo(s) to build, the order in which they ought to be build, etc.  Could be the Jenkins file.
[x] remove polymer and nutmeg? (would need to rewrite wuf-code-sample and wuf-messages as angular components)
[x] forms page warning: It looks like you're using ngModel on the same form field as formControl. 
[ ] update Gridster to include component loading
[x] clean up form page.  Remove drawer
[ ] make resize bar transparent.  Just use cursor.
[ ] ensure navigation with horizontal orientation highlights top-level navigation element when child element is active
[ ] Smart Table fixes:
    [ ] forms.js:1181 
        It looks like you're using ngModel on the same form field as formControl. 
        Support for using the ngModel input property and ngModelChange event with 
        reactive form directives has been deprecated in Angular v6 and will be removed 
        in Angular v7.
        
        For more information on this, see our API docs here:
        https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControlDirective#use-with-ngmodel
