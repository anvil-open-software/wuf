        <div class="component_tabs_1">

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong>, from common components, is used to configure the application
                in different ways. For example, configuration settings may include where to position the navigation
                panel (e.g., left or top) or the default application theme to use (e.g., dark or light). The
                configuration service is also used to keep track of some application state (e.g., the current size of
                the resizable sidebar panel) while the user is interacting with the application.</p>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service is responsible for storing and retrieving application
                configuration data in local storage, providing those setting to the rest of the application, and then
                broadcasting any configuration updates. Components from common components, as well as the application
                itself, can then use the <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service's data to configure themselves
                in different ways. In this way, the <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service serves as a central
                hub for updating and retrieving application configuration data.</p>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service provides certain defaults for a given application
                while allowing the user to override those defaults while interacting with a given application. By
                storing these settings on both the backend and in local storage, we can then persist these settings
                across user sessions as well as across any device both with and without a network connection.</p>

            <p>While the <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service is responsible for saving configuration to
                local storage, it will <strong>NOT</strong> send your updated config information back to the server for
                you. However, it's very easy to subscribe to configuration updates within your app and then, when your
                app is notified of configuration changes, send those changes back to the server. The server can then do
                whatever it wants with that configuration data (like save it in a database). See the <strong>Persisting
                    Configuration</strong> section below.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>Sources of Configuration Data</h2>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service should be used to manage configuration settings. The
                values for these settings themselves can come from a number of different sources, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Data from component defaults</li>
                <li>Data from application defaults</li>
                <li>Data from local storage</li>
                <li>Data from the server</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Component Defaults</h4>

            <p>Any component that uses configuration data should be coded by the developer with some built-in defaults.
                The navigation component, for example, uses "left" as the default orientation. This means that if the
                navigation component receives <em>no values</em> from the <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong>
                service, it will default to left. There is no need for an application developer to provide these values
                since they are built in to the components themselves.</p>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service itself includes the following default values (which
                are stored in JSON format):</p>

            <wuf-code-sample [code]="serviceDefaultExample" type="javascript"></wuf-code-sample>

            <h4>Application Defaults</h4>

            <p>The application should include some default values. For the Living Style Guide, these values are stored
                in a file at <code>/src/app/internal/configuration/configuration.ts</code>. This file has the following
                values:</p>

            <wuf-code-sample [code]="appDefaultExample" type="javascript"></wuf-code-sample>

            <h4>Server Data</h4>

            <p>When a user logs in, the backend should send some minimal configuration data to the application. This
                data can be stored in the user's JWT payload or requested via a separate API call.</p>

            <p>Any data sent from the server will take precedence over data from any other source. This allows the
                server to override any local user settings should it need to.</p>

            <p>Minimal data from the server should include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>User ID</li>
                <li>username</li>
                <li>First Name</li>
                <li>Last Name</li>
            </ul>

            <wuf-code-sample [code]="serverDataExample" type="javascript"></wuf-code-sample>

            <p>Note that this JSON object only has one property: "user", which provides an object of its own. The user
                ID from the user object is used to store application settings in local storage under a unique storage
                key from application ID + user ID. Note that it is good practice for the the user object from the server
                to <em>not</em> include password data.</p>

            <p>As noted above, any setting data from the server will override setting data from any other sources. This
                means that server data can also include application id, navigation, theme, and other properties, as
                necessary.</p>

            <h4>Local Storage</h4>

            <p>Whenever configuration data is received from the server or generated locally through user interaction
                (e.g., changing the theme from light to dark), the complete set of configuration data is stored locally
                in the browser's local storage. This allows us to re-use this data should the network fail, for
                example.</p>

            <h4>Putting it All Together</h4>

            <p>As described above, configuration data can come from a number of different sources. The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong>
                service will then smartly merge configuration data from these sources together into a single
                configuration object using the following priority order:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If user settings are received from the backend with new attributes or with modified values, use
                    these new/modified values. Server settings overrule all other settings.
                </li>
                <li>If no new or modified setting values are received from server, use setting values stored in local
                    storage. These stored values were saved there during a previous user session.
                </li>
                <li>If no local or stored settings values exist, use default application settings pulled from the
                    application's configuration file <code>/src/app/internal/configuration/configuration.ts</code>.
                </li>
                <li>If no default application settings exist in
                    <code>/src/app/internal/configuration/configuration.ts</code>, use the default settings baked into
                    each components (which should always be coded with default values).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>By <em>merging</em> data in this way, any of the data sources can send <em>partial configuration
                data</em> (in JSON format) to the service. Property/value data that doesn't yet exist in the
                configuration the configuration object managed by the <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> are added
                while the values for existing properties are replaced with the new values.</p>

            <p>The above cascade order ensures that any configuration value sent from the server <strong>always</strong>
                wins. Given that this is the case, it's important that the server only override local settings when
                necessary.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Loading Application Configuration</h2>

            <p>The Living Style Guide (this application) provides an example of the above configuration retrieval,
                merging, and local storage behavior in <code>app.component.ts</code>:</p>

            <wuf-code-sample [code]="appComponentExample" type="typescript"></wuf-code-sample>
            <caption>/src/app/app.component.ts</caption>

            <p>The <code>this.userService.authenticate(fakeLoginData).subscribe()</code> line is called from <code>ngOnInit()</code>.
                This is done to simulate a user login and subscribe to the results. Note that since this application
                doesn't have a backend, we are using a <code>HttpInterceptor</code> from <code>src/app/internal/fake-backend.service.ts</code>
                to intercept URL requests to <code>'/api/*'</code> and return fake data. In a production environment,
                this file should be removed so that all requests are passed through to an API service.</p>

            <p>The login process returns an object with user data. This object is then passed to the
                getMergedConfiguration() function where user data is merged with data (if any) from local storage and
                application defaults. Once the merged configuration is returned, it is passed to the <code>WufConfigurationService</code>
                with the line:</p>

            <pre><code>this.configService.config = mergedConfiguration;</code></pre>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service then updates the config in memory and saves it to
                local storage. The <code>WufConfigurationService</code> then broadcasts that the configuration object in
                memory has been updated.</p>

            <p>The following line shows the subscription to the onConfigChange() observable within <code>app.component.ts</code>:
            </p>

            <pre><code>this.configService.onConfigChange().subscribe()</code></pre>

            <p>When the broadcast of an updated configuration is received, the <code>onConfigChange()</code> method is
                called and passed the updated configuration object. The <code>onConfigChange()</code> function then
                decides what, if anything, to do with the updated config. In this case, it looks for a new theme id and,
                if found, applies that theme id to the root &lt;html&gt; tag. It also looks to see if a dark theme
                should be applied and updates the &lt;html&gt; tag as necessary. The browser then renders the new
                styling accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Persisting Configuration</h2>

            <p>It's also important to ensure that local settings created by the user during interaction (e.g., switching
                from light to dark theme) be sent back to the server so that these settings can be persisted across user
                sessions, browsers, and devices. In the code above the <code>onConfigChange()</code> function includes a
                note about where/when you should send configuration data back to the server.</p>

        <div class="component_tabs_2">
            <h2>Installation</h2>

            <p>The <strong>WufConfigurationService</strong> service is included in the
                <strong>@anviltech/wuf-ang-configuration</strong> package, which is already included in an Quick Start-based
                app.
            </p>

            <p>If not already installed, you can install it with the following command:</p>

            <pre><code>npm install @anviltech/wuf-ang-configuration --save</code></pre>

            or

            <pre><code>yarn add @anviltech/wuf-ang-configuration</code></pre>

            <p>Be sure this component is imported from your <code>app.module.ts</code>
            page:</p>

            <wuf-code-sample type="typescript" [code]="setupCode1"></wuf-code-sample>

            <p>And then add it to the <code>providers</code> array of <code>app.module.ts</code>:</p>

            <wuf-code-sample type="typescript" [code]="setupCode2"></wuf-code-sample>

            <p>Every submodule in your application must also import the service and add it to the corresponding <code>*.module.ts</code>
                page for the submodule.</p>

            <p>When using the service inside of a component (in order to access configuration properties or to subscribe
                to configuration updates) you must also add the service to the component page itself. See the examples
                under the <strong>Intro</strong> section.</p>

            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>The configuration object is purposefully defined of type &lt;any&gt; so that it can take any shape an
                application developer needs it to. However, in order for components, app layout, etc. to make use of
                properties stored in the configuration object, certain properties/structures are expected, as
                follows:</p>
