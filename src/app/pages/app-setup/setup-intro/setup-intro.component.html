    <h1>Application Setup</h1>

    <p>The Common Components Library provides a number of components, styles, and application configuration options. By
        assembling the components as we need, loading some base styles, and tweaking some configuration settings, we can
        build pages with headers, sidebars, footers, and content areas easily and with a high degree of flexibility.
        Additionally, the base styles provided by common-components give us all the styles we need for common HTML
        elements in order to ensure that they match UX Board guidelines. Finally, by utilizing the pre-built layouts
        included in the Quick Start app and a number of configuration options, we can easily set the orientation and
        style of layout for each page. In a nutshell, by taking care of layouts and base styles for us, we can focus our
        development efforts on page <strong>content</strong>, knowing that everything else is already handled for us.
    </p>

    <p>In order to better understand how layouts work within the WUF framework, we recommend reading each of the
        following sections and following their instructions to ensure your application is correctly set up with the
        layouts and base styles it needs.</p>
