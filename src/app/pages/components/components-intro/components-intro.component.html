    <h1>Intro to Components</h1>

    <p>Apps based on <strong>WUF's Library of Components</strong> have a variety of component flavors to choose
        from. Underneath the covers, a component can be based on Angular (an Angular component), Polymer (a Polymer
        component), or the standards-based web component spec (a web component).
    </p>

    <p>Ultimately, it doesn't matter what technology a given component uses, since all of these components are designed
        to play nicely with each other. Instead, as a developer, you should pick whichever component works best for the
        use case you are coding against.
    </p>

    <p>
        The pages within this section each document the installation, usage, and design patterns for different components
        available within WUF.
