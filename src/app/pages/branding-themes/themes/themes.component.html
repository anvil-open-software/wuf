    <h1>KION Theme System</h1>

    <p>The collection of visual design styles, <a routerLink="/themes/colors">color palette</a>, typography, button
        shapes, and the like, are referred to as a "theme". By carefully selecting the decorative styles that constitute
        a theme, a theme can be applied to any application in order to create a <strong>brand identity</strong>.</p>

    <p>The mechanism by which WUF has implemented theming allows easy switching between design aesthetics by providing
        specific values for all of the customizable attributes that constitute a theme. The end result of such
        customization creates a <strong>KION Theme</strong> for each application based on WUF or any similar
        implementation mechanism.</p>

    <p>It is highly recommended that, once a theme has been identified and implemented, it be applied to all
        applications available under the same brand. Doing so will help ensure a consistent user experience across
        applications and that design aesthetics for each are not allowed to deviate significantly from one another.</p>

    <h2>Theming in Practice</h2>

    <p>Theming affects the entire UI, including individual components, like a button. This example shows how a button
        component’s out-of-the-box values can be customized.

    <p>A contained button is assigned values for a specific color, shape, and type family. By default, contained buttons
        uses the styles defined by the "Dematic" theme.</p>

    <p>You can adjust the default color, type, and shape of this contained button to suit your app’s style.The following
        Material button shows the default button styles against the base color <code>secondary-lighter-50</code>. Use
        the droplist control to apply different themes and view the differences.</p>

    <div class="example-button" #exampleButtonWrap>
        <mat-form-field>
            <mat-select placeholder="Select button theme" [(value)]="buttonTheme"
                        (selectionChange)="onButtonThemeSelectChange($event)">
                <mat-option [value]="theme" *ngFor="let theme of themes">{{theme.label}}</mat-option>
            </mat-select>
        </mat-form-field>

        <div class="button-wrap">
            <button mat-raised-button color="primary" #exampleButton>Accent</button>
        </div>
        <div class="exampleText" *ngIf="buttonTheme.id !== 'dematic'">
            The color is <strong>{{exampleTextColor}}</strong>.<br>
            The fill color is <strong>{{exampleFillColor}}</strong>.<br>
            The text is <strong>{{exampleFontSize}}</strong>, <strong>{{exampleFontWeight}}</strong> weight.<br>
            The text decoration is <strong>{{exampleTextDecoration}}</strong>.<br>
            The font-face is <strong>{{exampleFontFace}}</strong>.<br>
            The button corners have a rounded radii of <strong>{{exampleBorderRadius}}</strong>.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Creating a Theme</h2>

    <p>Every application based on the Quickstart App (including the Living Style Guide) uses a <strong>Dematic</strong>
        branding theme out-of-the-box &#151; because we need some default, fallback values for our theming mechanism.
        This is fine if your application falls under the umbrella of the Dematic product suite. Fortunately, for those
        applications that must be branded to match a customer's brand (e.g., Amazon or Walmart) or that must be branded
        to match another brand under the KION umbrella (Linde or Still), it is extremely easy to override the default
        Dematic theme.</p>

    <p>The <strong>wuf-web-assets</strong> package includes all of the CSS, SCSS, and SCSS convenience functions
        necessary to create and use another theme within a given application.</p>

    <p>Creating a theme that can be applied a given application is a 4 step process. All steps are optional, except for
        the color definition step:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Define theme colors (required)</li>
        <li>Define brand logo</li>
        <li>Define button radius</li>
        <li>Define font styles</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once your theme has been created you can apply it to your application. There are two ways of applying a theme to
        an application:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Apply within the app using Angular bundling</li>
        <li>Apply as an external CSS file</li>
    </ol>

    <p>NOTE: The sole purpose of creating a theme is to generate a series of CSS custom properties populated with values
        you create through the theming process. These CSS custom properties are then used throughout the application for
        styling components, layouts, and misc high-level styles, like typographic styles. For the most part, these CSS
        custom properties are transparent to the application developer, but it's helpful to konw what CSS custom
        properties are generated by the theming mechanism should you decide to use them or override them in a given
        context. For reference, refer to the <a routerLink="/themes/cssprops">Theme CSS Custom Properties page</a> for a
        list of generated CSS custom properties.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Define Theme Colors (Required)</h2>

    <p>The first step in creating a theme requires the creation of a <code>.scss</code> file. The process described
        below assumes you already understand how to create a <code>.scss</code> file and are familiar with associated
        syntax.</p>

    <p>When <a routerLink="/thems/colors">colors</a> are applied to a theme, all components within an application will
        pick up those colors automatically. As demonstrated by the example branding files at <code>/src/assets/dummydata/branding/brands</code>,
        we first declare SCSS variables in our <code>.scss</code> file for each of the colors in the <a
            routerLink="/themes/colors">KION Color System</a> and then pass them into the <code>wuf-theme-colors()</code>
        method as a SCSS map. Note that in order for CSS custom properties to work they must be bound to some object in
        the DOM. In the following, we're binding to the &lt;body&gt; tag because it more specific than the :root (i.e.,
        HTML element) tag that the default KION theme binds to, but generic enough to be easily overridden.</p>

    <wuf-code-sample
        type="scss"
        [code]="exampleColorCode">
    </wuf-code-sample>

    <p>This process defines all of the colors used in a KION Theme and binds their CSS custom properties to some
        high-level element (in this example it's the &lt;body&gt; tag). Components from the component library along with
        Material Design Components should now start showing the colors you defined in your theme.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Define Brand Logo</h2>

    <p>The <code>wuf-theme-logo()</code> method allows you to override the default logo-related CSS custom properties for
        the logo that appears in the application's header area. When creating a theme, you'll most likely also want to
        change the logo associated with that theme. This allows you to support multiple brands within the same
        application.</p>

    <p>There are some cases where you may <strong>not</strong> want to include a logo override in your application. If
        you are designing a Dematic application, for example, you may simply want to create a "dark theme" to override
        the colors and leave everything else as is.</p>

    <p>Like the theme colors above, the properties for logo overrides must be bound to a high-level DOM element, like
        the &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>

    <wuf-code-sample
        type="scss"
        [code]="exampleLogoCode">
    </wuf-code-sample>

    <hr>

    <h2>Define Button Radius</h2>

    <p>The <code>wuf-theme-logo()</code> method allows you to optionally override the default corner radius for
        application buttons. View the <a routerLink="/themes/cssprops">Theme CSS Custom Properties page</a> for a list
        of generated CSS custom properties.</p>

    <p>Like the other methods defined above, these properties must be bound to a high-level DOM element, like the &lt;body&gt;
        tag.</p>

    <wuf-code-sample
        type="scss"
        [code]="exampleButtonCode">
    </wuf-code-sample>

    <hr>

    <h2>Define Font Styles (Typography)</h2>

    <p>The <code>wuf-theme-typography()</code> method allows you to optionally override the default font styling. View
        the <a routerLink="/themes/cssprops">Theme CSS Custom Properties page</a> for a list of generated CSS custom
        properties.</p>

    <p>Like the other methods defined above, these properties must be bound to a high-level DOM element, like the &lt;body&gt;
        tag.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Any font file used by your application should be included in the local file system. All
        assets (like fonts) should be bundled in the app's assets folder in order to avoid having to require access to
        external CDNs and other network-based assets.</p>
    <wuf-code-sample
        type="scss"
        [code]="exampleFontCode">
    </wuf-code-sample>

    <hr>

    <h2>Putting it All Together</h2>

    <p>The following shows an example of a brand override SCSS file that uses all of the functions above to create a
        complete theme that overrides the default Dematic theme. As discussed above, this is a SCSS file so it requires
        server-side pre-compilation before it can be sent to the browser (if you include your scss partial using Angular
        bundling &#151; see below &#151; this process is handled for you).</p>
    <wuf-code-sample
        type="scss"
        [code]="exampleCodeComplete">

    <h2>Applying a Theme</h2>

    <p>There are two ways of applying a theme to an application:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Apply within the app using Angular bundling</li>
        <li>Apply as an external CSS file</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Angular Bundling</h4>

    <p>The <strong>Living Style Guide</strong> (this application) includes a number of example files that demonstrate
        the mechanism for creating new themes in order to override the default Dematic theme. You can view these files
        within the <a
            href="https://gitlab.dematic.com/cloud_visualization_services/living-style-guide/tree/master/src/assets/dummydata/branding"
            target="_blank">repository</a> itself or within your local version of the Living Style guide at <code>/src/assets/dummydata/branding</code>.
    </p>

    <p>We have very intentionally placed these example theme files in a folder called "dummydata" within the Living
        Style Guide application because, while we want to show examples of the mechanism used to create themes, we
        recognize that you may <strong>not</strong> want to use the specific approach demonstrated by this application
        to <strong>apply</strong> theme/branding files to your app.</p>

    <p>In the Living Style Guide example, the branding files at <code>/src/assets/dummydata/branding/brands</code> are
        all @included inside a branding.scss file and then bundled into the Angular bundle at build time via the <code>angular-cli.json</code>
        file. This is necessary because the Living Style Guide is a stand-alone, single-page application with no
        backend. For a real-world application, however, you may want to create your CSS theme file server-side and then
        send it to the client application for consumption via a &lt;link&gt; tag in your <code>index.html</code> file.
    </p>

    <p>To use this approach create your <code>.scss</code> (called "branding.scss" in the following example) file within
        your <code>assets/</code> folder, then ensure that your <code>angular-cli.json</code> points to that file via
        the following line in the <code>apps.styles</code> property:</p>

    <pre><code>"assets/dummydata/branding/branding.scss"</code></pre>

    <p>When Angular compiles your application, the branding.scss file will be built and bundled into your application.
        The advantage of this approach is that it requires no server. The downside of this approach is that you cannot
        overrides SCSS variables with values from a database, for example. This means that the brands your application
        can use are limited to those you define in advance and bundle with your app. For many applications that will
        only ever have one theme/brand, this approach is likely sufficient.</p>

    <h4>External CSS File</h4>

    <p>The advantage of generating a brand CSS file server-side is that you can populate the values for the various SCSS
        variables from a database, configuration file, or some other mechanism. A run-time SCSS compiler could then be
        used to generate a final CSS file which could then be cached and sent to the browser upon request. This
        mechanism would provide the ultimate theming flexibility. CSS custom properties can be overridden in a browser
        at run-time, and because a CSS theme file simply creates a collection of CSS custom properties with
        pre-determined values, this mechanism would allow a developer to serve an application to any number of different
        customers from the <strong>same application server</strong> while sending each customer their own theme. This
        model is far more efficient for those deployments that require their own theme/brand than it would be to support
        separate application instances and servers for every customer deployment.</p>

    <p>The means by which you create the final CSS files will depend on the server technology you are using for your
        application's backend, so we won't spend any time here cover the myriad ways your CSS file could be
        generated.</p>

    <p>Assuming your CSS file is generated server-side, you will want to ensure that your <code>angular-cli.json</code>
        does <strong>not</strong> include the following line in the <code>apps.styles</code> property (i.e., if it's
        there, remove it):</p>

    <pre><code>"assets/dummydata/branding/branding.scss"</code></pre>

    <p>To load your CSS theme, include it in your application using a standard <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in your
        application's index.html file. It would looks something like this:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://myserver.com/styles/mystyles.css"&gt;</code></pre>

    ...where the href points to your backend server. The server should return a fully formed CSS file (e.g.,<code>brand.css</code>)
    based on the SCSS compilation process described above.

    <hr>

    <h2>A Note About Base-Href</h2>

    <p>It's possible to override the base-href used in an angular app using the following build command:</p>

    <pre><code>ng build --base-href /myUrl/</code></pre>

    <p class="small">(See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/build#base-tag-handling-in-indexhtml"
                             target="_blank">Angular Documentation</a> for information on using this command.)</p>

    <p>In order to account for the ability of the developer to change the base href, developers of components and
        WUF-based applications must keep the following in mind:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ensure all asset paths in SCSS use absolute paths (e.g., <code>background-image:
            url("/assets/images/example_images/logos/bmw.svg")</code>).
        </li>
        <li>URLs in HTML should keep relative paths (e.g., <code>"&lt;img
            src="/assets/images/example_images/logos/bmw.svg"&gt;</code>).
        </li>
        <li>Ensure all paths in SCSS in EXTERNAL components (e.g., @anviltech/wuf-web-assets) use relative paths.</li>
    </ul>
