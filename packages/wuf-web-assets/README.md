Base Styles
===============

While most of the page layout for each application page is handled by layout-related components, the <body> and <html> tags are outside of the scope of any component (including those components used for layout).  These high-level elements need certain styling in order for our layouts to work as expected.  Similarly, there are some common, global styles that we want/need to apply to our application in order handle everything from base font size, line height, paragraph spacing, list decoration, etc. in a manner consistent with our style guide.</p>

Dependencies
------------
This package has some peer dependencies.  To install these dependencies, run the following commands from your application root:

```bash
npm install @angular/material@7.3.2 material-components-web@0.44.0 --save
```

or

```bash
yarn add @angular/material@7.3.2 material-components-web@0.44.0
```

Installation
-------------------------------------
In order to easily apply these high-level, global styles we have created a collection of such styles and provided them for use from the library of components via a single SCSS file import.  To use it, add the `@anviltech/wuf-web-assets` package to your application by running the following command from your command line:

```bash
$ npm install @anviltech/wuf-web-assets
```

... then add the following to your application's `style.scss` file:

```typescript
@import "~@anviltech/wuf-web-assets/assets/styles/library‚Äù;
```

This @import will bring all of the base styles from the Common Components Library into your app and provide the following benefits:
* Reset the styling of many HTML elements to baseline for consistency across browsers (using a flavor of normalize.css).</li>
* Provide a number of SCSS utility functions and mixins, including some for responsive breakpoints.</li>
* Provide a number of convenience classnames, including some for handling flex-box layouts.</li>
* Create a default theme and brand style.  Read more about theming and brand overrides in the <a routerLink="/themes">Branding &amp; Themes</a> section.</li>
